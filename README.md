# Battlebricks Competition Timer

[![Battlebricks Timer Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silviu-toderita/battlebricks_timer/main/docs/video_thumb.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_XwcW9traM "Battlebricks Timer Overview")

Competition timer for a game of all-out remote-controlled LEGO Battlebricks destruction. Based on an ESP8266 WiFi-enabled Microcontroller, it features an LED matrix displays that faces the audience, and a smaller LED matrix display that faces the players. Both displays show a mix of text and graphics depending on the status of the game. 

The Battlebricks Timer was used at the [BrickCon 2021 Battlebricks Tournament](https://battlebricks.org/)! Watch [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiqxc3ZPi2Y) & [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBWVR5-2r30).

## Features
- Set your prefered game time and change it between rounds with the push of a button
- Supports 2 players, 3 players, and a free-for-all "rumble mode"
- External and on-screen light bars show which players are ready
- Fully configurable over wifi on mobile-friendly settings page
- Built-in buzzer for audio feedback
- Over-The-Air firmware updates

### Schematic

![Battlebricks Timer Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silviu-toderita/battlebricks_timer/main/docs/schematic.jpg)
*NOTE: When using WS2812 LED Matrix Displays, connect ALL VCC and GND wires to the 5V and GND rails respectively, as peak current draw may be too much for a single pair of wires to handle!*


## Firmware

Written in C++ for the ESP family of connected microcontrollers, and using the Arduino framework. Developed using Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO. A platformio.ini file is included; If you clone the repository and open it up with Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension installed, the dependencies should download automatically. 

*NOTE: In addition to flashing the firmware to the microcontroller, you must also [flash the file system](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-vs-code-platformio-spiffs/).*
